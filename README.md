# pkmn-route-rando
A key item/warp randomizer for Pokemon Red and Blue, in development.

Inspired by stump's Pok√©mon Red/Blue Key Item Randomizer: https://github.com/stump/keyrand
(pieces of the patcher code were shamelessly lifted from there)

CURRENTLY MAPPING OUT LOGIC: up through most of Lavender Town and Pokemon Tower

## HOW TO USE
Don't. It doesn't even randomize everything yet. You can currently, however, run "patcher.py [rom filname] [flags]" to implement some map changes and randomize items ~~and warps~~ (*please don't randomize warps at the moment*) up to a certain point (see above). There is no completion logic applied here yet, however. **The program only accepts unaltered UE region Pokemon Red or Blue games!**

### Flags
- See [the Wiki](https://github.com/Color-Printer/pkmn-route-rando/wiki/Flags) for more flags and details.
- **--items [item flags]** - Shuffles items. Item flags are lists of characters separated by spaces. Invalid flags are ignored unless they make Python yell at you or something.
  - **K** - Shuffles all Key Items.
  - **N** - Shuffles non-key items received from NPCs.
  - **I** - Shuffles item ball pickups.
  - **H** - Shuffles hidden items.
  - For example, using "K I" in your flag set will shuffle Key Items with other Key Items, item ball pickups with other item balls, and leave NPC items and hidden items alone. "KN IH" will shuffle Key Items and NPC items together and item balls and hidden items together, and "K N I H" will shuffle everything in its own pool, and "KNIH" will shuffle all four pools in one large pool.
  - If you already use a flag in one pool and try to put it in another, it will be ignored. Only the first occurrence of each flag counts.
- **--warps** - Shuffles warps.
- ***DO NOT USE THE WARP SHUFFLE UNTIL IT IS MAJORLY REFACTORED SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - PROGRAM WILL ALMOST NEVER GENERATE A VALID SEED***
- See the wiki page linked above for some more flags. More information will be added here later.

## IMPLEMENTED
- A solver that can attempt to go from point A to point B with a set starting inventory, picking up items along the way
- An algorithm for finding "bridges" in the map, useful for making sure the player can't find their way to the other side of one-way obstacles
- Shuffling and mixing of various item pools
- Warp shuffling (***NOT GOOD***, currently being reworked to be less chaotic and more sensible)
- No logic has been connected yet to either shuffles, with the exception of making sure all locations are physically connected in one group and each town has direct access to exactly one Pokemon Center
- Writing patches to a ROM file, including logic fixes and behind-the-scenes fixes to make the replacements work properly
- Basic seed functionality
- An option to start right in Oak's Lab, allowing Red's House and Oak's Lab to be shuffled
- An option to allow HMs to be used regardless of badges you have obtained
- An "I Know Where Hidden Items Are" option that removes the Itemfinder requirement from hidden item logic

## Logic Changes From Base Game (these are actually implemented in the patcher)
- Path between Viridian City and Route 2 is blocked until the Pokedex is acquired (originally just from VC to R2)
  - Viridian Gym is on the Route 2 side of this obstacle, and the ledge below it has been turned into a fence
  - Cut can also be used to bypass the old man
- Path between Pewter City and Route 3 is blocked until the player acquires one badge (originally just from PC to R3, and when the player beat Brock)
- You can no longer hop down a ledge to get back to Pewter City after leaving the backside of the Pewter Museum
- You can return to Mt. Moon from Cerulean City along Route 4
- You can no longer use the ledge to the right side of Cerulean Gym to return to the main area of the city from the outside
- The officer guarding the burgled house in Cerulean is moved from the beginning
- Both fossils can be obtained from Mt. Moon
- S.S. Anne does not leave after getting the Cut HM
- The Saffron City guards block passage from both sides until Tea is acquired
  - Tea was backported in from FRLG, and is *normally* obtained at the first floor of the Celadon Mansion

## Things To Keep In Mind
- Every town has direct access to exactly one Pokemon Center
  - The Mt. Moon and Rock Tunnel Pokemon Centers are left as is...for now
  - This does NOT apply to PokeMarts or Gyms unless the --onemart or --onegym flag is used, respectively
- The back entrances of Pokemon Mansion and the Power Plant lead back to wherever the regular entrance leads (unless the --backdoors flag is used)
- Flash is available before you have to traverse Rock Tunnel
- If key items are shuffled with hidden items, you will always be able to get the Itemfinder before picking up any hidden items (unless the --knowhidden flag is used)
- The Potion in your PC counts as a key item location
 
## Things To Keep In Mind That Don't Actually Apply Yet
- Mr. Fuji teleports the player to wherever the entrance of Pokemon Tower is instead of his house. You still have to find him again and talk to him to get the Poke Flute
  - If dungeon areas are disconnected, Mr. Fuji will not teleport the player at all
- Nothing past the entrance to Route 23 is shuffled (though the entrance itself is), meaning the Victory Road and Indigo Plateau are left intact
  - The order of the Elite Four are shuffled, however. Champion is still last
- Safari Zone is left intact
- The Viridian Gym entrance requires any seven badges (originally required the first seven specifically)
- 
## Things to Implement Later
- An option to skip the Oak's Parcel delivery (it and its location will be removed from the pools)
- Anything I put on the Flags page on the wiki that are marked as not implemented
- Fill out this README more, and better
